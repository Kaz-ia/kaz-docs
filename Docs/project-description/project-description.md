The configuration page: on the configuration page he can create a category and he can create a jobs, the job is  working like a category, and we call it privet jobs because, only the user how created can use it.
inside of the job he should create a document type, this document type can be any document need to be verified ( ex : devis , facture , audit ,...) then he shoots to define the fields that he want extract for analyze for example (full name , address price, total price, ex..), this fields can be any things on the document, and we call it also private document type because, only the user how created can use it.
or he can use the predefined jobs with the predefined document types - this predefined jobs and predefined documents types it's created by the admin
the user can create a workspace and add the rols that should be respakted during the verification process.
on the workspeace he can define the document types of a job to use them on the verification so he can compare the documents based on the fields that he define on the document type.
the workspace can be public or private, if it's public all the users can use it, if it's private only the user how created can use it.
the public workspace it's created by only the admin and all the users can use it.
